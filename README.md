# CV Maker

Program which creates .pdf curriculum vitae file and fill it with user data.

## How does it work

It's too simple to describe it.

### Why it is so great

You don't need the Microsoft Office to create your CV!

## Built With

* Microsoft Visual Studio 15.7.1
* [iText 7](https://github.com/itext/itext7) - an open source PDF engine to create your smart document workflow
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - copying and pasting from stack overflow
* [Google](http://google.com/) - googling and googling

## Plans for the future
I will make GUI, when I will know how to do it. So not quickly.
